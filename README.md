# My Rust Web App with Actix-Web and Docker

Welcome to the **Rust Web App** repository! This is a simple yet powerful web application built with Rust using the Actix-Web framework and containerized using Docker. Perfect for learning, experimenting, or just having fun with Rust and Docker!

## Features

- **Rust with Actix-Web**: Harness the power and safety of Rust with the Actix-Web framework.
- **Dockerized**: Easily build, run, and scale with Docker.
- **Docker Compose**: Simple orchestration for local development.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

##  Getting Started

Here's a step-by-step guide to get your Rust web app up and running.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-web-app.git
cd rust-web-app


### 2. Build and Run with Docker Compose

Use Docker Compose to build the Docker image and run the container:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will build the Rust application and start the web server.

### 3. Access the Web App

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You should see the message:

```
Hello, Rust with Actix-web!
```

##  Project Structure

Here's a quick overview of the project structure:

```plaintext
rust-web-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.rs         # Main application code
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml          # Rust dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile          # Docker image definition
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml  # Docker Compose configuration
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # This file!
```

##  Detailed Instructions

### `src/main.rs`

This file contains the core application logic. It's a simple Actix-Web server that responds with a friendly message.

### `Cargo.toml`

This file manages the dependencies for our Rust project. We're using Actix-Web for our web framework.

### `Dockerfile`

Our Dockerfile defines the environment for our Rust application. It includes a multi-stage build to ensure our final image is lightweight and efficient.

### `docker-compose.yml`

This Docker Compose file makes it easy to manage our services. Right now, we just have one service for our web app, but you can easily extend this to include databases, caching servers, etc.

## My Tips and Tricks

- **Hot Reloading**: For development, you might want to set up hot reloading. Check out tools like `cargo-watch` to automatically rebuild your Rust code when files change.
- **Extending the App**: Try adding new routes, integrating a database, or deploying it to a cloud service like AWS or Azure.
